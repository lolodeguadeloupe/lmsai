# Implementation Plan: Plateforme de Création de Cours IA

**Branch**: `001-plateforme-de-cr` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/laurent/mesprojets/lms/creationcours/specs/001-plateforme-de-cr/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
AI-powered course generation platform that automatically creates comprehensive courses with chapters, assessments, and study materials adapted to target audience levels. System must generate level-appropriate content (beginner to expert), validate pedagogical quality, and export in standard formats (SCORM, xAPI, QTI) while maintaining <2 minute generation time per chapter and 95% success rate.

## Technical Context
**User Request**: "ecris les taches afin de realiser les specifications" (write tasks to implement the specifications)
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (AI/ML libraries compatibility)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (REST API), OpenAI/Anthropic SDK (content generation), Pydantic (data validation)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (course/user data), Vector DB (content embeddings), File storage (exports)  
**Testing**: pytest (unit/integration), httpx (API testing), factories (test data)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (containerized deployment)
**Project Type**: web (backend API + frontend interface)  
**Performance Goals**: <2min chapter generation, 95% success rate, 100 concurrent generations  
**Constraints**: <200ms API response (p95), pedagogical quality validation, SCORM/xAPI compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Educational institutions, multi-language support, enterprise-grade reliability

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Library-First**: ✅ Core AI generation logic will be standalone libraries  
**CLI Interface**: ✅ Each service will expose CLI for testing/debugging  
**Test-First**: ✅ TDD approach with tests before implementation  
**Integration Testing**: ✅ API contracts, inter-service communication, schema validation  
**Observability**: ✅ Structured logging, monitoring, text I/O for debugging  
**Simplicity**: ✅ Start with MVP, avoid over-engineering

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - backend API + frontend interface as indicated in Technical Context

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [x] Phase 4: Implementation complete (100% complete, 67/67 tasks done)
- [x] Phase 5: Validation passed (quickstart validation: 100% success rate)

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
