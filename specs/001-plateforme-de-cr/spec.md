## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An educator wants to create a comprehensive course on a specific subject (e.g., "Introduction to Machine Learning") for a beginner audience. They input the subject and target level, and the system automatically generates a complete course structure with chapters, content, assessments, and study materials, all adapted to the appropriate difficulty level and learning progression.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an educator has a subject and target audience level, **When** they submit a course creation request, **Then** the system generates a complete course outline with appropriate number of chapters and learning objectives for that level.

2. **Given** a course outline has been generated, **When** the system creates chapter content, **Then** each chapter contains level-appropriate vocabulary, examples, and complexity suitable for the target audience.

3. **Given** course content has been generated, **When** the system creates assessments, **Then** quiz questions follow the appropriate cognitive distribution (e.g., 60% memory, 30% understanding, 10% application for beginners).

4. **Given** a course is complete, **When** an educator reviews the generated content, **Then** all learning objectives are covered with measurable success criteria and the content follows logical progression.

5. **Given** multiple courses are generated simultaneously, **When** system resources are under load, **Then** generation time remains within acceptable limits (‚â§2 minutes per chapter).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user requests an expert-level course on a topic with insufficient source material?
- How does the system handle course generation failure partway through the process?
- What occurs when generated content doesn't meet quality thresholds?
- How does the system adapt when conflicting learning objectives are specified?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Course Structure & Content Generation
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate course structures with appropriate number of chapters based on target difficulty level (3-5 for beginner, 5-8 for intermediate, 8-12 for advanced, 10-15 for expert)
- **FR-002**: System MUST adapt vocabulary complexity and technical terminology usage according to specified audience level
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate learning objectives that are specific, measurable, and aligned with course content
- **FR-004**: System MUST create content progression that builds logically from fundamental to advanced concepts
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate practical examples appropriate to the target audience's experience level

#### Assessment Generation
- **FR-006**: System MUST create quiz questions with cognitive level distribution appropriate to target audience (specific percentages defined per level)
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate multiple question types including multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, short answer, and practical applications
- **FR-008**: System MUST create flashcards with spaced repetition metadata for optimal learning retention
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all assessments align with stated learning objectives and course content
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate appropriate number of assessment items per chapter based on complexity level

#### Content Quality & Validation
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate content readability scores meet level-specific thresholds (‚â•70 for beginner, ‚â•60 for intermediate, ‚â•50 for advanced)
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure 100% coverage of declared learning objectives in generated content
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain consistent terminology and concept definitions throughout course materials
- **FR-014**: System MUST verify logical sequence and dependencies between chapters and concepts
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate appropriate balance of theoretical and practical content for each level

#### Export & Integration
- **FR-016**: System MUST export courses in multiple standard formats (SCORM 2004, xAPI, QTI 2.1, PDF, HTML)
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide structured data output for integration with Learning Management Systems
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain course version control and update tracking
- **FR-019**: System MUST support batch export of multiple courses and course components

#### Performance & Scalability
- **FR-020**: System MUST generate individual chapters within 2 minutes maximum processing time
- **FR-021**: System MUST maintain 95% or higher generation success rate
- **FR-022**: System MUST support concurrent generation of multiple courses (minimum 100 simultaneous operations)
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide real-time progress tracking for course generation processes

#### User Experience
- **FR-024**: Users MUST be able to specify course subject, target audience level, estimated duration, and content preferences
- **FR-025**: Users MUST be able to preview generated content before final course creation
- **FR-026**: Users MUST be able to regenerate specific chapters or sections that don't meet their requirements
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide quality metrics and recommendations for generated content

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Targets

- **NFR-005**: User satisfaction with generated courses MUST be ‚â•85% in feedback surveys
- **NFR-006**: Content must pass automated validation checks for structural and pedagogical completeness

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Chapter**: Represents a major learning unit within a course with sequential numbering, learning objectives, estimated duration, complexity level, prerequisites, content outline, and collection of subchapters

- **Subchapter**: Represents detailed learning content within a chapter including content type (theory/practical/mixed), structured content blocks (text, images, videos, code, diagrams), examples, key concepts, summary, and additional resources

- **Quiz**: Represents chapter-level assessment containing multiple questions with different types, difficulty levels, cognitive levels (remember/understand/apply/analyze/evaluate/create), correct answers, explanations, and hints

- **Flashcard**: Represents concept-focused study material with front/back content, difficulty and importance ratings, spaced repetition metadata, and relationships to other concepts

- **Target Audience**: Represents learner characteristics including proficiency level (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert), prerequisites, age range, professional context, and learning preferences

- **Quality Metrics**: Represents content assessment criteria including readability scores, pedagogical alignment ratings, objective coverage percentages, and user satisfaction scores
