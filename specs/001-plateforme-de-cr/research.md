# Research: Plateforme de CrÃ©ation de Cours IA

**Phase 0 Output** | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Feature**: 001-plateforme-de-cr

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. AI Content Generation Technologies

**Decision**: OpenAI GPT-4 + Anthropic Claude integration
**Rationale**: 
- OpenAI GPT-4 excels at structured content generation and maintains consistency
- Anthropic Claude provides better pedagogical reasoning and safety filters
- Dual-provider approach ensures reliability and quality redundancy

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Single provider (OpenAI only): Risk of rate limits and single point of failure
- Open-source models (Llama, Mistral): Lower quality for educational content, higher infrastructure costs
- Google Gemini: Limited educational content optimization

### 2. Vector Database for Content Embeddings

**Decision**: Pinecone or Chroma (based on scale requirements)
**Rationale**: 
- Pinecone for production (managed, scalable, reliable)
- Chroma for development/testing (lightweight, local development friendly)
- Both support semantic search for content similarity and quality validation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Elasticsearch: General-purpose, less optimized for semantic search
- PostgreSQL with pgvector: Good integration but limited scale
- Weaviate: Feature-rich but higher complexity

### 3. SCORM/xAPI Compliance Libraries

**Decision**: PyLTI/py-scorm + custom xAPI implementation
**Rationale**:
- PyLTI provides LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) foundation
- SCORM 2004 export via custom serialization (XML packaging)
- xAPI (Tin Can API) for modern learning analytics

**Alternatives considered**:
- Commercial solutions: High licensing costs, vendor lock-in
- Full custom implementation: High development effort, compliance risks

### 4. Content Quality Validation Framework

**Decision**: Multi-layered validation with pedagogical metrics
**Rationale**:
- Readability analysis (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG index)
- Pedagogical structure validation (Bloom's taxonomy alignment)
- Content accuracy verification via fact-checking APIs
- Bias detection and content safety filtering

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual review only: Not scalable for automated generation
- Simple keyword filtering: Insufficient for educational quality
- External API only: Cost and latency concerns

### 5. Performance Architecture

**Decision**: Async task queue with Redis/Celery
**Rationale**:
- Course generation as background tasks (>2min processing)
- Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket connections
- Horizontal scaling capability for concurrent generations
- Failure recovery and retry mechanisms

**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous processing: Poor user experience for long operations
- AWS Lambda: Cold start latency, 15min timeout limit
- Native async/await: Limited scaling and monitoring capabilities

### 6. Data Model Architecture

**Decision**: Domain-driven design with aggregate roots
**Rationale**:
- Course as aggregate root with chapters/subchapters as entities
- Clear bounded contexts for generation, validation, export
- Event sourcing for audit trail and rollback capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flat relational model: Poor encapsulation, complex queries
- Document database: Less ACID guarantees, complex relationships
- Microservices: Over-engineering for initial MVP

## Implementation Priorities

1. **MVP Core**: Basic course structure generation with single AI provider
2. **Quality Layer**: Content validation and pedagogical scoring
3. **Export Engine**: SCORM/xAPI compliance and multi-format export
4. **Scale Features**: Multi-provider redundancy, advanced caching
5. **Enterprise**: Multi-tenancy, advanced analytics, custom branding

## Risk Mitigation

- **AI Provider Limitations**: Implement circuit breaker pattern, graceful degradation
- **Quality Control**: Human review workflow for edge cases
- **Performance**: Aggressive caching, pre-computed templates
- **Compliance**: Regular validation against LMS integration standards
